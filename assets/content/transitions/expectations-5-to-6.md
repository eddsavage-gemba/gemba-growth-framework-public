# Progressing from Principal → Principal+ (Business Growth Leader)

This progression is about shifting from shaping delivery to shaping the future of Gemba.

As a Principal, you influence outcomes across teams and clients, bringing calm, judgement, and strategic oversight.

As a Principal+, your impact is measured in years, not projects. You grow service lines, shape leadership culture, build long-term client partnerships, and represent Gemba externally. You create space for others to lead and focus on building capability that lasts.

This is leadership at an organisational and industry level.

## Sphere of Influence

- Principal: Delivery and strategy across engagements
- Principal+: The organisation, its direction, and its reputation

## Signs You Might Already Be Operating at the Next Level

- You think in terms of long-term capability and growth
- You sponsor initiatives rather than running them
- You connect strategy, people, and clients naturally
- Others look to you for direction beyond immediate delivery
