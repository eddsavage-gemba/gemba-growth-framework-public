# Progressing from Senior (Individual Contributor) → Senior (Lead)

This progression is about shifting from personal impact to enabling others at scale.

As a Senior Individual Contributor, your strength is your judgement and expertise. You raise the bar through how you think, decide, and support others — without formal authority.

As a Senior Lead, your primary responsibility becomes the health and effectiveness of a team or workstream. You create clarity, delegate deliberately, give feedback early, and balance delivery with people care. Success is no longer “did I do great work?” but “did the team succeed sustainably?”

This is the point where leadership becomes explicit.

## Sphere of Influence

- Senior Individual Contributor: Delivery quality and professional decisions
- Senior Lead: Teams, ways of working, and client delivery

## Signs You Might Already Be Operating at the Next Level

- You naturally take responsibility for how the team is doing
- You think about who should do work, not just how it’s done
- People look to you for clarity during uncertainty
- You balance progress with protecting team health
