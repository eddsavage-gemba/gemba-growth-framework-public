# Progressing from Independent Problem-Solver → Senior (Individual Contributor)

This progression is about moving from reliable autonomy to trusted judgement.

As an Independent Problem-Solver, you’re trusted to deliver your work well without hand-holding. You make good day-to-day decisions, manage your own workload, and communicate clearly. Your focus is still largely on your own work — just done independently.

As a Senior Individual Contributor, people come to you when things are unclear or difficult. You’re comfortable operating in ambiguity, breaking down complex problems, and helping others make better decisions. Your impact comes not just from what you deliver, but from how much clearer, calmer, and higher-quality things become when you’re involved.

This shift is about becoming a multiplier, not just a doer.

## Sphere of Influence

- Independent Problem-Solver: Your own delivery and decisions
- Senior Individual Contributor: Team quality, judgement, and confidence

## Signs You Might Already Be Operating at the Next Level

- Others seek out your judgement on tricky problems
- You reduce risk and confusion when you’re involved
- You mentor or coach without being asked
- You think in terms of systems and patterns, not just tasks
