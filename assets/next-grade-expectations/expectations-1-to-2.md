# Progressing from Curious Contributor → Independent Problem-Solver

This progression is less about learning more skills and more about changing how you approach work.

As a Curious Contributor, you’re still orienting yourself. You’re learning how Gemba works, what “good” looks like, and how your work fits into the bigger picture. You do your best work when things are clearly scoped, you ask questions early, and you rely on feedback to stay on track. It’s expected that you lean on others while you build confidence.

As an Independent Problem-Solver, you start creating momentum rather than waiting for it. You begin with intent instead of instructions, make reasonable decisions without waiting for permission, and explain your thinking as you go. You still ask questions — but they’re about options and trade-offs, not uncertainty. You own work end-to-end and keep things moving even when the path isn’t perfectly clear.

At the heart of this step is trust — both from others and in yourself.

## Sphere of Influence

- Curious Contributor: Your own work and learning
- Independent Problem-Solver: Your own delivery, plus growing influence on peers and outcomes

## Signs You Might Already Be Operating at the Next Level

- You usually form a plan before asking for direction
- You make sensible assumptions and keep moving
- People trust you to take work away without frequent check-ins
- You’re comfortable saying “here’s my recommendation”
